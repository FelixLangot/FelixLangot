- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FelixLangot
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things, but here on GitHub I'm mostly looking for ways to improve my computing skills for scientific research
- :mortar_board: I've been using python/jupyter/LaTex for several years, but I'm still a beginner. I have some experience in writing bash scripts as well, and I have been introduced to parallel computing.
- ðŸŒ± I would like to learn other languages, partly out of curiousity but mostly if it can help in my field of study
